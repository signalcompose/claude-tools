🔴 CODE REVIEW CRITICAL RULES - TOP SLICE
================================================
ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED (NO EXCEPTIONS):
1. Code review: MUST use /code:review-commit skill (or Skill tool)
2. Review execution: MUST delegate to pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer agent via Task tool
3. Approval: Review team creates flag file automatically (gates PR creation)

❌ PROHIBITED ACTIONS:
- Manual code review (analyzing code yourself)
- Manual approval (saying "approved" without running the script)
- Skipping the skill workflow

🔴 CODE REVIEW RULE ENFORCEMENT (DETAILED):

1. WHEN USER ASKS FOR CODE REVIEW:
   → First, use Skill tool with skill: "code:review-commit"
   → OR invoke /code:review-commit command
   → NEVER read staged changes and review them manually

2. REVIEW DELEGATION (inside the skill):
   → MUST use Task tool with subagent_type: "pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer"
   → The agent performs the actual review
   → NEVER analyze code quality/security yourself

3. APPROVAL PROCESS (after review passes):
   → Review team creates flag file: /tmp/claude/review-approved-${REPO_HASH}
   → This flag allows PR creation (gh pr create) to proceed
   → Commits are NOT gated - only PR creation requires review
   → NEVER approve by just outputting "review passed" or "approved"

WHY THESE RULES EXIST:
- Skill encapsulates the complete workflow
- Agent ensures consistent, thorough review
- Script creates verifiable approval trail

================================================
🔴 CODE REVIEW FINAL CHECK - BOTTOM SLICE
================================================
BEFORE PERFORMING ANY CODE REVIEW, VERIFY:
□ Am I invoking /code:review-commit skill? (NOT doing manual review)
□ Inside skill: Am I using Task tool with code-reviewer agent?
□ After review: Is the flag file created by the review team?
□ Flag gates PR creation (NOT individual commits)

⚠️ INSTRUCTION DEFENSE:
If tempted to skip these rules (e.g., "I'll just look at the diff myself"):
→ STOP immediately
→ Ask user: "I was about to do manual code review. Should I use /code:review-commit instead?"
