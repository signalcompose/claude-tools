description: "Setup shell sync checker (use /chezmoi:shell-sync-setup skill instead)"
---

This command has been replaced by the `shell-sync-setup` skill.

Use `/chezmoi:shell-sync-setup` or say "set up shell sync checker".

The skill provides the same functionality and loads details on demand to reduce context usage.
